"API stability refers to some level of guarantee from a project that its API "

"Generally, an API is considered ‘stable’ if it commits to backwards-"
"compatibility (defined below); but APIs could also commit to being unstable "
"or even forwards-compatible. The purpose of API stability guarantees is to "
"allow people to use your project from their own code without worrying about "
"constantly updating their code to keep up with API changes. Typical API "
"stability guarantees mean that code which is compiled against one version of "
"a library will run without problems against all future versions of that "
"library with the same major version number — or similarly that code which "
"runs against a daemon will continue to run against all future versions of "
"that daemon with the same major version number."

"The normal approach to memory management is for the programmer to keep track "
"of which variables point to allocated memory, and to manually free them when "
"they are no longer needed. This is correct, but can be clarified by "
"introducing the concept of <em>ownership</em>, which is the piece of code "
"(such as a function, struct or object) which is responsible for freeing a "
"piece of allocated memory (an <em>allocation</em>). Each allocation has "
"exactly one owner; this owner may change as the program runs, by "
"<em>transferring</em> ownership to another piece of code. Each variable is "
"<em>owned</em> or <em>unowned</em>, according to whether the scope "
"containing it is always its owner. Each function parameter and return type "
"either transfers ownership of the values passed to it, or it doesn’t. If "
"code which owns some memory doesn’t deallocate that memory, that’s a memory "
"leak. If code which doesn’t own some memory frees it, that’s a double-free. "
"Both are bad."

"Unit tests should be written in conjunction with looking at <link xref="

"tests</link>. This typically means writing an initial set of unit tests, "
"running them to get coverage data, then reworking and expanding them to "
"increase the code coverage levels. Coverage should be increased first by "
"ensuring all functions are covered (at least in part), and then by ensuring "
"all lines of code are covered. By covering functions first, API problems "
"which will prevent effective testing can be found quickly. These typically "
"manifest as internal functions which cannot easily be called from unit "
"tests. Overall, coverage levels of over 90% should be aimed for; don’t just "
