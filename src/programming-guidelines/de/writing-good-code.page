  <title>Die Bedeutung von gutem Code</title>

  <p>
    GNOME is a very ambitious free software project, and it is
    composed of many software packages that are more or less
    independent of each other.  A lot of the work in GNOME is done by
    volunteers:  although there are many people working on GNOME
    full-time or part-time for here, volunteers still make up a large
    percentage of our contributors.  Programmers may come and go at
    any time and they will be able to dedicate different amounts of
    time to the GNOME project.  People’s “real world” responsibilities
    may change, and this will be reflected in the amount of time that
    they can devote to GNOME.
  </p>

  <p>
    Software development takes long amounts of time and painstaking
    effort.  This is why most part-time volunteers cannot start big
    projects by themselves; it is much easier and more rewarding to
    contribute to existing projects, as this yields results that are
    immediately visible and usable.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thus, we conclude that it is very important for existing projects
    to make it as easy as possible for people to contribute to them.
    One way of doing this is by making sure that programs are easy to
    read, understand, modify, and maintain.
  </p>

  <p>
    Messy code is hard to read, and people may lose interest if they
    cannot decipher what the code tries to do.  Also, it is important
    that programmers be able to understand the code quickly so that
    they can start contributing with bug fixes and enhancements in a
    short amount of time.  Source code is a form of
    <em>communication</em>, and it is more for people than for
    computers.  Just as someone would not like to read a novel with
    spelling errors, bad grammar, and sloppy punctuation, programmers
    should strive to write good code that is easy to understand and
    modify by others.
  </p>

  <p>Im folgenden finden Sie einige wichtige Qualitätsmerkmale von gutem Code:</p>

  <terms>
    <item>
      <title>Cleanliness</title>
      <p>
	Clean code is easy to read with minimum effort.  This lets
	people start to understand it easily.  This includes the
	coding style itself (brace placement, indentation, variable
	names), and the actual control flow of the code.
      </p>
    </item>

    <item>
      <title>Konsistenz</title>
      <p>
	Consistent code makes it easy for people to understand how a
	program works.  When reading consistent code, one
	subconsciously forms a number of assumptions and expectations
	about how the code works, so it is easier and safer to make
	modifications to it.  Code that <em>looks</em> the same in two
	places should <em>work</em> the same, too.
      </p>
    </item>

    <item>
      <title>Erweiterbarkeit</title>
      <p>
	General-purpose code is easier to reuse and modify than very
	specific code with lots of hardcoded assumptions.  When
	someone wants to add a new feature to a program, it will
	obviously be easier to do so if the code was designed to be
	extensible from the beginning.  Code that was not written this
	way may lead people into having to implement ugly hacks to add
	features.
      </p>
    </item>

    <item>
      <title>Korrektheit</title>
      <p>
	Finally, code that is designed to be correct lets people spend
	less time worrying about bugs, and more time enhancing the
	features of a program.  Users also appreciate correct code,
	since nobody likes software that crashes.  Code that is
	written for correctness and safety (i.e. code that explicitly
	tries to ensure that the program remains in a consistent
	state) prevents many kinds of silly bugs.
