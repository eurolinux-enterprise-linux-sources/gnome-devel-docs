    <p>
      git is used for version control for all GNOME projects. This page assumes
      good working knowledge of git; some introductory material is available
      <link href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/">here</link>, and a
      <link href="https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf">git

    <title>Use of Git</title>

    <p>
      Most GNOME repositories follow these rules:
    </p>
    <list>
      <item><p>
        No forced pushes. Except for branches with the <code>wip/</code> prefix
        (work-in-progress), the commitsâ€™ history must not be modified, as
        contributors rely on it.
      </p></item>
      <item><p>
        Rebase commits rather than merging, to have a linear history (which is
        easier to follow).
      </p></item>
      <item><p>
        Work on feature branches on GNOME git in <code>wip/</code> branches,
        then rebase on master and fast-forward merge the changes. It is a good
        practice to also add your nickname to the branch name, as
        <code>wip/nickname/feature</code>.

  <section id="guidelines-for-making-commits">
    <title>Guidelines for Making Commits</title>

    <p>
      Commits should be as small as possible, but no smaller. Each commit should
      address a single issue, containing only changes related to that issue. The
      message for each commit should describe the issue, explain what causes it,
      and explain how it has been fixed if it is not obvious. If the commit is
      associated with a bug report, the full URI for the bug report should be
      put on a line by itself at the bottom of the commit message. Similarly,
      the ID for the git commit (from <cmd>git log --oneline</cmd>) should
      be copied into the bug report once the commit has been pushed, so it is
      easy to find one from the other.
    </p>

    <p>
      The changes in each commit should be easy to read. For example, they
      should not unnecessarily change whitespace or indentation. Large,
      mechanical changes, such as renaming a file or function, should be put in
      separate commits from modifications to code inside that file or function,
      so that the latter changes do not get buried and lost in the former.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following principles give the reasoning for all the advice above:
    </p>
    <list>
      <item><p>
        Each commit should take the repository from one working state to
        another, otherwise
        <link href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Debugging-with-Git#Binary-Search">bisection</link>
        is impossible.
      </p></item>
      <item><p>
        Each commit should be individually revertable. If it later turns out
        that the commit was a bad idea,
        <cmd>git revert <var>commit ID</var></cmd> should take the repository
        from a working state to another working state.
      </p></item>
      <item><p>
        The reasoning for each commit, and its relationship to external
        resources like specifications and bug reports, should be clear, to the
        extent that commits written by one developer a year in the past should
        still be understandable by a second developer without having to trace
        through the changes and work out what they do.
      </p></item>
      <item><p>
        Each commit should be written once, and designed to be read many times,
        by many reviewers and future programmers.
      </p></item>

    <title>Merging Procedure</title>

    <p>
      To merge a feature branch named <code>my-branch</code> into master, use
      the following commands:
    </p>
    <code mime="application/x-shellscript">
git checkout master
git pull

git checkout wip/<var>my-branch</var>
git rebase --interactive master
# Ensure the rebase is successful; test the changes

git checkout master
git merge wip/<var>my-branch</var>
git push

# wip/<var>my-branch</var> can now be deleted
git push origin :wip/<var>my-branch</var>
git branch -D wip/<var>my-branch</var></code>
