<title>Photo wall</title>

<synopsis>
  <p>For this example we will build a simple image viewer using Clutter. You will learn:</p>
  <list>
    <item><p>How to size and position <code>ClutterActor</code>s </p></item>
    <item><p>How to place an image in a <code>ClutterActor</code> </p></item>
    <item><p>How to do simple transitions using Clutter's animation framework</p></item>
    <item><p>How to make <code>ClutterActor</code>s respond to mouse events</p></item>
    <item><p>How to get file names from a directory</p></item>

<section id="intro">
  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>
    Clutter is a library for creating dynamic user interfaces using OpenGL for hardware acceleration. This example demonstates a small, but central, part of the Clutter library to create a simple but attractive image viewing program.
  </p>
  <p>
    To help us reach our goal we will be utilising a few other common pieces of GLib as well. Most importantly, we'll use one <code>GPtrArray</code>, a dynamic array of pointers, to hold the file path names. We will also use <code>GDir</code>, a utility for working with directories, to access our image directory and gather file paths.

  <title>Create a project in Anjuta</title>
  <p>Before you start coding, you'll need to set up a new project in Anjuta. This will create all of the files you need to build and run the code later on. It's also useful for keeping everything together.</p>
  <steps>
    <item>
    <p>Start Anjuta and click <guiseq><gui>File</gui><gui>New</gui><gui>Project</gui></guiseq> to open the project wizard.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
    <p>Choose <gui>GTK+ (simple)</gui> from the <gui>C</gui> tab, click <gui>Continue</gui>, and fill out your details on the next few pages. Use <file>photo-wall</file> as project name and directory.</p>
   	</item>
    <item>
    <p>Make sure that <gui>Use GtkBuilder for user interface</gui> is disabled as we will
    create the UI manually in this tutorial. Check the <link xref="guitar-tuner.c">Guitar-Tuner</link>
    tutorial using the interface builder.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
    <p>Enable <gui>Configure external packages</gui>. On the next page, select
       <em>clutter-1.0</em> from the list to include the Clutter library in your project.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
    <p>Click <gui>Apply</gui> and the project will be created for you. Open <file>src/main.c</file> from the <gui>Project</gui> or <gui>File</gui> tabs. You should see some code which starts with the lines:</p>
    <code mime="text/x-csrc"><![CDATA[
#include <config.h>
#include <gtk/gtk.h>]]></code>

  </steps>

  <title>A look at Photo Wall</title>
  <p>
    Our image viewer presents the user with a wall of images.
  </p>
  <media type="image" mime="image/png" src="media/photo-wall.png"/>
  <p>When an image is clicked, it is animated to fill the viewing area. When the image having focus is clicked it is returned to its original position using an animation with the same duration of 500 milliseconds.
  </p>
  <media type="image" mime="image/png" src="media/photo-wall-focused.png"/>

  <p>A few words on the arguments we are not using in this example. The <code>ClutterEvent</code> is different depending on what event is being handled. For example, a key event produces a <code>ClutterKeyEvent</code> from which you can get the key being pressed among other information.
