In these situations body parts should <emphasis>not</emphasis> be used. Even in situations where the metaphor is appropriate (for example an eye representing the sawfish appearance capplet) it is better to avoid using a body part. Often body parts have been used in GNOME to suggest a human \"choosing\" or \"using\" something. This is normally an unnecessary point for the icon designer to make. People naturally attempt to understand objects in reference to themselves (show someone a bat and they will think of hitting something with the bat, show someone a tool and they will think of using it, etc). For example, the font selector shows a finger pointing to an \"F\" suggesting the user choosing between a series of fonts. A better icon would be the text \"Aa\" presented in an ornate font (calling attention to the font rather than the text).

Even after being familiar with the \"system log monitor\" being represented as a log, users do not form the association fast enough for the icon to assist through in scanning through menu entries. A popular instance of this problem was the proliferation of icons representing the \"World Wide Web\" as a spider web in the mid 1990s. Part of the value of icons is that they bypass linguistic comprehension and hence are complementary to captions, allowing users to utilize more areas of the mind than linguistic recognition (already used in scanning for captions) when they hunt for items."

These components play an important part in giving a group of icons a collectively distinctive look. For instance, the Java Look and Feel, or \"metal,\" is recognizable by its use of a primary eight-color palette, interior highlighting and diagonal gradients. The Macintosh Look and Feel, or \"aqua,\" is recognizable by its use of a cool palette based on blue, lighting effects mimicking reflectivity and antialiasing.
