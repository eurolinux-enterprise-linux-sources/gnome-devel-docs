"Because GNOME aims to be an international desktop, it needs to avoid imagery "

"fingers; body parts that are considered \"clean\" in one culture (such as "
"eyes), will be considered tasteless or gross to another (such as a nose). "
"Based on a survey of icons in GNOME, body parts frequently appear in the "

"they are being used as an ineffective crutch for poor metaphor. In these "
"situations body parts should <emphasis>not</emphasis> be used. Even in "

"for the icon designer to make. People naturally attempt to understand "
"objects in reference to themselves (show someone a bat and they will think "
"of hitting something with the bat, show someone a tool and they will think "
