<title>Grids</title>

<media type="image" mime="image/svg" src="figures/patterns/grid.svg"/>

<p>A grid is one of the primary methods of presenting collections of content in GNOME 3. Grids are often combined with a number of the other design patterns, including <link xref="search">search</link> and <link xref="selection-mode">selection mode</link>.</p>

<title>When to use</title>

<p>Since the grid view utilizes an image for each item it presents, it is best suited to content that has a visual component, such as documents or photos. If content items don't have a visual component, a <link xref="lists">list view</link> might be more appropriate.</p>

<p>Grids and lists can be combined, to offer different views of the same content. This can be useful if content items have additional metadata associated with them, such as creation dates or authorship.</p>
