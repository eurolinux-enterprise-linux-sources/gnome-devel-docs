<title>Patterns</title>

<p>Patterns are the primary elements that make up an application design. Some patterns, like <link xref="application-menus">application menus</link> or <link xref="header-bars">header bars</link>, are highly recommended. Others are optional, and deciding on which patterns you want to use forms a core part of the design process. To help with this, each pattern page details the appropriate uses of each pattern, and suggests alternatives that might be applicable.</p>

<p>Once you have decided which patterns to use, the <link xref="ui-elements">user interface elements pages</link> provide details of individual elements that you can use to fill out your design.</p>
