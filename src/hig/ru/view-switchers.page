<p>A view switcher is a control that allows switching between a number of predefined views. It appears as a set of toggle buttons that are placed in the center of a header bar.</p>

<title>When to use</title>

<p>There are two primary cases when a view switcher is appropriate:</p>

<list>
<item><p>When presenting content, and it is useful to be able to view different sets or sub-sets of content. For example, a music application could show different views for artists, albums and playlists.</p></item>
<item><p>If your application provides discrete groups of functionality which are typically used independently.</p></item>
</list>

<p>As a rule of thumb, a view switcher should contain between three and five views. If you have more views, a <link xref="sidebar-lists">sidebar list</link> might be a more appropriate view switching control.</p>
