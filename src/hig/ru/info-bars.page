<title>Info bars</title>

<media type="image" mime="image/svg" src="figures/patterns/info-bar.svg"/>

<p>An info bar is a strip that is placed above a content view, directly below the header bar or tool bar. It contains text, and can also include controls. Info bars persist: they can be permanent, or they can be dismissed by the user.</p>

<title>Когда использовать</title>

<p>Info bars can be used to communicate a particular state about a particular content item or location. For example, an info bar could indicate that a document is out of date or being edited by other, or that a service relating to a location is not operating. In some situations, they can also be used to present supplementary information, such as user guidance.</p>

<p>Since info bars are persistent, they are generally more appropriate for communicating ongoing states rather than events (<link xref="notifications">notifications</link> or <link xref="in-app-notifications">in-app notifications</link> are more appropriate here).</p>

<p>Info bars primarily communicate by using text, and have the advantage that they can include both a heading and a longer explanation. However, they also take up space and attract attention. If the state you want to communicate is not critical, or can be communicated through a simple string or icon, you might want to consider alternative approaches: text or icons can be added elsewhere in your interface, or the appearance of navigation controls (such as <link xref="view-switchers">view switchers</link>, <link xref="tabs">tabs</link> or <link xref="sidebar-lists">sidebar</link> lists) can be changed.</p>
