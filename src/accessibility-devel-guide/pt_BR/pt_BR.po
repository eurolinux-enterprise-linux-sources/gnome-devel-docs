"The Accessibility Toolkit (ATK) describes a set of interfaces that need to "

"such as GTK, Motif or Qt."
msgstr ""

#: C/accessibility-devel-guide.xml:57(para)
msgid ""
"The implementation for the GTK widgets is in a module called GAIL (GNOME "
"Accessbility Implementation Library), which is dynamically loadable at "
"runtime by a GTK application. Once loaded, those parts of your application "
"that use standard GTK widgets will have a basic level of accessibility, "
"without you having to modify your application at all. If GAIL is not loaded, "
"GTK widgets will have a default accessibility implementation that "
"essentially returns no information, though it nominally conforms to the ATK "
"API. Applications which use Bonobo controls, particularly out-of-process "
"ones, also load accessibility support code from module libgail-gnome. "
"Whether or not applications on the GNOME desktop automatically load these "
"accessibility support libraries depends on the value of a "
"<application>gconf</application> key, \"/desktop/gnome/interface/"
"accessibility\"; a boolean value of \"true\" enables support for assistive "
"technologies and applications which call gnome_program_init will "
"automatically load the appropriate accessibility libraries at runtime. "
"\"Pure GTK+ applications\", e.g. those that use gtk+ but do not link to "
"libgnome, rely on the value of the GTK_MODULES environment variable, which "
"must be set to \"gail:atk-bridge\" in order to enable assistive technology "

"Most assistive technologies running on other desktops have historically "
"found it necessary to maintain a complex off-screen model of the desktop "
"applications, based on snooping of OS events, use of unsupported OS and "
"application features and API, and other highly non-portable techniques. This "
"has made assistive technology support somewhat \"brittle\" and highly OS- "
"and application-specific, even application-version specific. In contrast, on "
"the GNOME Desktop, all the information required by the ATs is provided by "
"the running applications, via the GNOME Accessibility Framework, to a "
"toolkit-independent Service Provider Interface (SPI). The SPI provides a "
"means for UNIX-based ATs, such as screen readers and screen magnifiers, to "
"obtain accessibility information from running applications via a consistent, "
"stable API, and can eliminate the need for an off-screen model in many "
"cases. Accessibility support for applications is \"built in\" to application "
"toolkits via toolkit-appropriate APIs (for instance, ATK for most native C "
"applications and the Java Accessibility API for Java apps), and exported to "
