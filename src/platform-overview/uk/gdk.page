<title>GDK</title>

<p>GDK is the low-level library used by GTK+ to interact with the
system for graphics and input devices.  Although you will rarely use
GDK directly in application code, it contains all the necessary
functionality to draw objects and text to the screen and to interact
with the user with various input devices.</p>

<p>GDK enables you to access events from keyboards, mice, and other
input devices, rather than connect to the high-level signals used in
GTK+.  GDK also provides low-level routines to access drag and drop
and clipboard data from the system.  When implementing custom controls,
you may need to access these features to implement proper user interaction
behavior.</p>

<p>GDK provides other functionality which is needed to implement
a complete graphical toolkit like GTK+.  Since GDK acts as a platform
abstraction, allowing GTK+ to run under multiple environments, it
provides an API for all of the system functionality needed by GTK+.
This includes information about multi-head displays, resolution and
color depth, colormaps, and cursors.</p>

<p>You should use GDK whenever you need low-level access to the
underlying windowing system, including low-level access to events,
windows, and the clipboard.  Using GDK for these tasks ensures that
your code is portable and integrates with the rest of your GTK+ code.
The simple drawing routines in GDK should generally not be used.
Instead, you should use the extensive functionality provide by
Cairo.</p>
