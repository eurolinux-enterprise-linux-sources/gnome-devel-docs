    <desc>Which license should you use for your application?</desc>

  </info>

  <title>License your application</title>

  <p>When you write a new application or library, you will need to choose a
  license so that others know how they can use or reuse your work.</p>

  <p>Libraries which are used in GNOME are usually licensed under the
  <link href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</link>
  <link href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html">LGPL 2.1</link>.</p>

  <p>Most newer GNOME applications are licensed under
  <link href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html">GPL3+</link>, while
  some of the older applications are licensed under
  <link href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GPL2+</link>.</p>

  <p>User help which is written by the GNOME Documentation Team is licensed
  under <link href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC-by-SA
  3.0 Unported</link>. The documentation team tries to use this license
  consistently as it allows re-use of text from Wikipedia and many other
  reference sources.</p>

  <p>Translations have the same license as the parent strings. For example,
  strings from the applications are usually GPL2+ or GPL3+, while user
  documentation is usually CC-by-SA 3.0.</p>

  <p>GNOME cannot give legal advice on which license you should choose, but you
  may want to read information that is available from the
  <link href="http://opensource.org/licenses">Open Source Initiative</link>,
  the <link href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-recommendations.html">FSF</link>
  and <link href="https://blogs.gnome.org/bolsh/2014/04/17/choosing-a-license/">Dave
  Neary's blog post about choosing a license</link>. You may also find the
  <link href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/licensing.html">GStreamer
  licensing information</link> of interest, as GStreamer uses plugins.</p>
