<title>Polkit</title>

  <p>Polkit, or Policy Kit, handles the policies that let unprivileged processes
  talk to privileged ones via <link xref="tech-d-bus">D-Bus</link> APIs. For
  example, not all programs should be allowed to request that the machine be
  disconnected from the network via the
  <link xref="tech-network-manager">NetworkManager</link> service.</p>

  <p>
    Polkit lets the system administrator define different policies for
    different services.  For example, only a user with physical access to the
    console may mount/unmount drives and volumes; users that are not at the
    console will need to type an administrator password.  On a machine for home
    users, most policies will be rather liberal, as the users can be trusted to
    take care of the machine.  On corporate settings, policies may be more
    restricted.

  <p>
    GNOME uses PolicyKit whenever applications need to request privileged
    operations.
