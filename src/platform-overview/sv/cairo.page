<title>Cairo</title>

<p>Cairo is a 2D graphics library featuring a sophisticated API for
drawing vector graphics, compositing images, and rendering anti-aliased
text.  Cairo provides support for multiple output devices, including the
X Window System, Microsoft Windows, and image buffers, allowing you to
write platform-independent code to draw graphics on different media.</p>

<p>The Cairo drawing model is similar to those provided by PostScript
and PDF.  The Cairo API provides such drawing operations as stroking and
filling cubic BÃ©zier splines, compositing images, and performing affine
transformations.  These vector operations allow for rich, anti-aliased
graphics without using expensive pixel-based drawing in your application
code.</p>

<p>Cairo's rich drawing model allows for high-quality rendering to
multiple media.  The same API can be used to create stunning on-screen
graphics and text, to render images, or create crisp output suitable
for printing.</p>

<p>You should use Cairo whenever you need to draw graphics in your
application beyond the widgets provided by GTK+.  Much of the drawing
inside GTK+ is done using Cairo.  Using Cairo for your custom drawing
will allow your application to have high-quality, anti-aliased, and
resolution-independent graphics.</p>
