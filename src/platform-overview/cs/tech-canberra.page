<title>Canberra</title>

<p>Canberra is a simple library for playing audio events and notifications,
such as when the user has received a message or an error has occurred.
As well as providing a convenient API, Canberra can also work with the
accessibility features of the desktop to provide alternate notification
for hearing-impaired users.</p>
