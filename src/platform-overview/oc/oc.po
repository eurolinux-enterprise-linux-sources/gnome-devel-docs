"As users work with more and more types of data in different applications, "
"they have an increasing need to share objects and data between their "

"work across multiple applications, including those not developed with GNOME."
msgstr ""

#: C/ipc-network.xml:17(para)
msgid ""
"The clipboard is used when a user explicitly copies data in an application. "

"GTK+."
msgstr ""

#: C/ipc-network.xml:23(para)

"Drag and drop operations are similar, but they require the pointer to be "
"tracked and updated as the user moves across potential drop targets. When an "
"application is notified a pointer is moving over it during an active drag, "
"it must update the cursor to indicate whether or not it can accept the drop. "
"GTK+ provides drag and drop support with a sophisticated API that makes it "

"Both the clipboard and drag and drop operations support content negotation. "
"When an application has data to offer, it advertises which formats are "

"CUPS provides a unified interface for printing, regardless of the location "

"Printer Description (PPD) files. PPD configurations allow applications to "
