<title>GUPnP</title>


  <p>
    Many "consumer electronics" devices that can make use of a house's local
    network support device and service discovery via a protocol called UPnP
    (Universal Plug and Play).  GUPnP lets GNOME applications discover UPnP
    devices on the network, and publish services themselves.

  <p>
    DLNA is a set of standards that let devices share multimedia content in
    standard formats.  GUPnP can also perform DLNA-related tasks such as media
    profile guessing, transcoding to a given profile, etc.
  </p>

  <p>
    In GNOME, GUPnP is one of the basic building blocks of home-multimedia
    software like Rygel, a home media server.
